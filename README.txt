I created most of these on the ClockworkPi PicoCalc running PicoMite.
Some of them I created on my desktop with notepad.

ASCII.bas - A small app that prints the ASCII value of any key that is pressed.
Calculator.bas - A caculator.  Supports + - * / and most of PicoMite built in arguments.
Gerrard.bas - A tiny chatbot with intent and context.  All very minimal, of course.
NoMansPi.bas - A space toy.  Not quite a game.  Hyperspace around and land on planets.
Prism.bas - A cool prism.
Scale.bas - A little musical instrument.
Slashmaze.bas - Prints a maze using /  and \.  Kindof a BASIC staple.
tontst.bas - Messing with 'play tone'.  Just an exploration of the function and it's arguments.
Wave.bas - A waveform visualizer.  Heavy usage of PIXEL.  +/- = freq  SPACE = waveform  A/Z = amp  T = thick  G = grid   W/X = speed  R = dir  P = pause  Q = quit
